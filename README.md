# Income Prediction Project
 
## What this project hopes to accomplish 
What we hope to accomplish with this project is to use Machine Learning models and tools to  predict who can earn more than $50,000 per year. 

These Machine Learning models will be trained using census data either collected by UC Irvine  Machine Learning or by us. For example, a person's income can be attributed by the age, work  occupation, location, highest schooling achieved, and other undetermined factors. Additionally,  we will explore the data and determine which features are considered relevant. We hope to  create at least one model that can attain an accuracy of > 80%. 

We will define this project as successful based on the accuracy of the model and the insights  that we can gain from the project. For example, finding that a person's ability to make >$50K  per year or not is affected by something like, let's say, marital status or native country would be  some good insight to attain. We will also be formulating new insights and hypotheses  throughout the project.
